## Neural Style Transfer in TensorFlow

This implementation is based on the original neural style transfer paper that came out in 2015. This generally follows the steps outlined in Andrew Ng's Convolutional Networks course although this time the implementation is done in Tensorflow 2.2 using the keras application module's implementation of VGG16.

Future updates will focus on improving the algorithm by which generation takes place along with supporting higher resolutions and other architectures like ResNet/Inception.

Trained and Tested on Google Collab.
